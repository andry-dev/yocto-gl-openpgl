Support and Contact
===================

Open PGL is under active development. Though we do our best to guarantee stable release versions, a certain number of bugs, as-yet-missing features, inconsistencies, or any other issues are still possible. Should you find any such issues, please report them immediately via [Open PGL's GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/OpenPathGuidingLibrary/openpgl/issues) (or, if you should happen to have a fix for it, you can also send us a pull request).
